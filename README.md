The goal of this pack that I made for myself is to provide a resource-intensive factory-building experience by seamlessly integrating Immersive Engineering, Create, and Farmer's Delight together. This means little to no content overlap, and somewhat unified progression. The details of the changes are largely contained the the "factoryguide" Patchouli book.
It also seeks to "disconnect" Minecraft's lore from the experience, instead opting to use generic industrial concepts. (Really this is just limited to .lang file renames, retextures, and non-Overworld dimensions not being required for progression)
This pack is meant to be added to (hence the "template"), but is entirely playable on its own.

I put it here on GitHub for others to reference and/or add to for their own packs. I intend to re-use it in personal packs in the future.
Examples of scripting/config done in this pack:
- Minimal to no content overlap; similar content but with different execution is often renamed, retextured, and/or fully or partially removed, for instance the IE belts are reworked into Rolling Belts
- Unified ore outputs, preferring IE's ingots etc
- IE Sawmill and Create Mechanical Saw recipes for all woods
- Renames of sets of blocks (including EveryCompat)
- Conditional script and Patchouli page loading depending on if mods are loaded
- Loot Table changes

Mods not included in the minecraftinstance.json but have some kind of integration are:
- Cloud Storage
- Create Slice and Dice
- Twilight Forest
