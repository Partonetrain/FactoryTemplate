The goal of this small pack is to provide a factory-building experience by seamlessly integrating Immersive Engineering, Create, and Farmer's Delight together. This means little to no content overlap, and somewhat unified progression. The details of the changes are largely contained the the "factoryguide" Patchouli book.
It also seeks to "disconnect" Minecraft's lore from the experience, instead opting to use generic industrial concepts. (Really this is just limited to .lang file renames, retextures, and non-Overworld dimensions not being required for progression)

This pack is meant to be added to (hence the "template"), but is entirely playable on its own. I put it here on GitHub for others to reference and/or add to themselves.

Mods not included in the minecraftinstance.json but have some kind of integration are:
- Cloud Storage
- Create Slice and Dice
