The goal of this small pack is to provide a factory-building experience by seamlessly integrating Immersive Engineering, Create, and Little Logistics together. This means little to no content overlap, and somewhat unified progression.
It also seeks to "disconnect" Minecraft's lore from said experience, instead opting to use generic industrial concepts. (Really this is just limited to Blazes not being required)

This pack is meant to be added to (hence the "template"), but is entirely playable on its own.
