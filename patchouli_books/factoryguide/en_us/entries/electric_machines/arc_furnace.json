It consists of a steel vat topped by electrodes which heat up the metal. $(br)The furnace excels at smelting ores (although its yield for Raw Ores will not be as great as the $(l:electric_machines/crusher)Crusher$()) and creating steel due to its high speed and its ability to process multiple items at the same time, but it is also complex in its workings and will require maintenance in order to continue functioning."

Right-clicking the panel, 'bucket' or vat will open the interface."
