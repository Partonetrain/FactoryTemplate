A single $(l:kinetic_generators/waterwheel)Water Wheel$() will be maximally stressed by the Alternator. However, it is a good source of entirely-passive electricity generation, espescially when paired with a $(l:kinetic_generators/windmill)Windmill$() or $(l:kinetic_generators/steam_engine)Steam Engine$()."
